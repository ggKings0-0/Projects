# Projects
I was really tired of making several repostitories for my projects, so I decided to create the united one.

# First Project
The easy-to-execute project explores and analyzes trends in Google search queries using Python programming. By leveraging the Pytrends library, this project aims to uncover insights into popular search topics, historical trends, regional interest, related queries, and keyword suggestions on Google.

I made it with the help of the documentations about dependencies, some YouTube guides and my own brain.
